## Project Overview

SafeHealth is a healthcare application designed to make accessing healthcare providers easier and more seamless. Our inspiration stems from the increasing challenges in public healthcare, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. SafeHealth aims to help users diagnose illnesses from home with accuracy and provide convenient access to healthcare professionals.

## Features

- **Symptom Diagnosis**: Users can self-diagnose common illnesses from home.
- **Doctor Communication**: Direct communication with assigned doctors or caregivers.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Apply for discounted fees and schedule appointments easily.
- **Health History Tracking**: Maintain and access a history of health records and test results.
- **Online Consultations**: Conduct follow-up appointments and routine check-ins online.

## Project Goals

- **Increase Accessibility**: Simplify the process of scheduling appointments and accessing medical history.
- **Improve Convenience**: Reduce the need for physical visits with online consultations and flexible scheduling.
- **Promote Timely Action**: Enable users to track their health status and receive prompt medical guidance.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Provide a user-friendly platform that accommodates various users, including the elderly and disabled.

## Project Planning

### Purpose
The project addresses the difficulties people face in seeking timely virus testing and medical consultations due to time and financial constraints. SafeHealth offers a convenient solution to these issues, encouraging early detection and better health management.

### Preliminary Findings
Traditional healthcare systems pose several challenges, such as long wait times, difficulty in scheduling urgent appointments, and increased exposure to illnesses in crowded waiting rooms. SafeHealth aims to mitigate these issues by providing a flexible and user-centric platform.

### Recommendations
- Implement online consultations and pre-examinations to reduce wait times.
- Offer flexible scheduling options to cater to diverse user needs.
- Integrate medical history tracking within the app for continuous care.
- Provide notifications and reminders for appointments and health check-ups.
